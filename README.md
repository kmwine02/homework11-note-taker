Homework 11 - Note Taker
  
 

  ## Description 
  This project is a note taker application. Users can enter notes with a title and note text and then click the save button. Once the save button has been clicked, the note will be stored in a json file within the application. Since the notes are saved to a json file, you can open the application from anywhere and see the notes that you saved. If you click the delete button, it will delete the note from the json file.
